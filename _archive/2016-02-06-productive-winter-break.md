title: A productive winter break

I had a very productive winter break. I managed to hit alot of milestones and that required a drastic change in my day to day routine. Amongst the things that I accomplished are:

* __Finishing 3 Pluralsight courses__
  * Advanced Javascript
  * Python Fundamentals
  * Python Beyond the Basics
* __Doing a chapter a day from the Test Driven Development with Python book__

I started by reading the [__You-Dont-Know-JS__](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) book series, managed to get past the first two and decided to just do the video lesson instead. I still plan to finish the rest of the books somewhere along this semester. As to Python, having worked on a Django project in the Fall, at times I felt that my understanding was lacking. So I took the time to really get the basics down, this has helped tremendously as I feel much more confident in my ability to read Python code. Consuming too much video material in one sitting is always a bad idea (found that the hard way), so I found balance by watching only an hour of the course per day. This was followed by practicing whatever I had learned right away. 

Learning the basics of a language was only part of my day, I used the rest of the day to read a chapter from [__TDD with Python__](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754/index.html). These chapters were **DENSE** so I had to spend a good 2 - 3 hours per chapter, that is only if things went smoothly, at times debugging would take a frustratingly long time. I managed to cover everything from Chapter 8 to Chapter 19. I still have 2 chapters until I wrap up the book, which will get done somewhere in this month. Overall it's been such a great book, hands-on teaching on the TDD practice. Really can't wait to start applying it to my own projects.

This pretty much sums it up, most of the week (I'd say 5/7 days) I would make sure that I got a hour of video and one chapter of the book down, no matter what. This wouldn't have been possible with the irregular sleep schedule that I had at that time. I needed to become a morning person. A morning person, gets more hours in the day and if I was to be productive at all, I needed all the time I could get my hands on.

> Become productivity-obssessed, wake up early, and get work done.

That's my new motto.
