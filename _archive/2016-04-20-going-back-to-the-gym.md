I went back to the gym this week. I did it to stop myself from making anymore excuses. I have feeling super lackluster in terms of drive lately and so to reignite myself with a sense of purpose, I have decided to start exercising again. It doesn't matter that I am injured, simply work around the problem. No excuses.
