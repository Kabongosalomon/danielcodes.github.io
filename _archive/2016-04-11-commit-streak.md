### The decision

Last month, I set a goal to keep a GitHub commit streak, that is a commit a day. There were a couple of reasons that led to this decision:

* practice ABC (always be coding)
* work on more projects

There's probably more, but those are the main ones. I had gotten into programming a bit late, if I wanted to keep up I needed to be constantly improving my skills. 

### What I've learned

I have managed to push a daily commit for the past 40 days

I can't say that I have managed to stay 100% true to my goal but I do have some interesting feedback. Setting the goal in itself was easy, so that was the easiest part, cutting the mental barrier. I also told myself that I wouldn't push out stupid commits, as in commits that didn't really count, my commits would be meaningful (or at least I would hope so). It is super hard to push out meaningful commits on a daily basis, coding is something that requires you to sit for an uninterrupted amount of time and just fight through problems. As fun as this is, I didn't always find the time to sit and think and program. And thus I cheated. But not really. Here's the breakdown of the repositories that I pushed to most often:

* [FreeCodeCamp log](https://github.com/danielcodes/fcc-projects), most of the FCC projects were done in CodePen so I just linked references to them in a repo
* [Today I learned](https://github.com/danielcodes/today-i-learned), I started reading programming books and decided to jot down useful code snippets
* [Blog posts](https://github.com/danielcodes/danielcodes.github.io), this posts are hosted through the GitHub, so free commits for every blog post

### What can be improved

This model is not perfect. I understand that the commits don't seem super meaningful but I have managed to find some work arounds that still center on me learning a bit of code everyday. Things to improve on include finding more of that quiet time where I can just sit uninterrupted and code away at a project. This is the most meaningful way to push commits to immerse yourself in a project and code away.
