I have been having trouble thoughts lately, mostly leaning towards jealousy. Whether it'd be a relationship that i don't have, or a material thing. I then begin to think as to what is it that I have. And obviously, the answer is that I have none of those things that I wish I had, that relationship or that material thing. All I have are goals. A mission, and work ethic. A willingness to bust my behind everyday and do whatever it takes to get to my goals. I understand that nothing is handed to anyone and only through hard work and sacrifice you will get to where you want to be in life.

Around the same time, I came across this video by Elliot Hulse:

It couldn't have come at a better time as I was feeling a bit down. It talks about man's mission-driven mentality. That you must not deter from your path no matter what. In the video, he's giving advice to a guy who's girlfriend wants him to go in a different direction than the one he wants to pursue. Things are a little different in my case, as I already have a goal in mind. I just need to execute.
