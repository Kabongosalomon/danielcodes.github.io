It's been one heck of a semester. From thinking, 'oh it's going to be fun learning this and that' to 'shit, I have to get this and that done', see the difference, not much fun. While I underestimated the semester's course load, I'd say that I've improved in other aspects. Those being controlling my temper when things go wrong and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. 

I'd like to address the first, my temper. Ever since I can remember i've always been a hot-head. I would always act in the spur of the moment, and deal with consequences after. This, of course, always got me into lots of trouble. Now, how does this relate to the present? Well, previously I ranted about being in a leadership position and having a hard time getting others to do their part. Although it's been a frustrating experience, I have learned that nothing good comes out of agitating myself further and that I have to deal with things in a calm manner and try not to break walls.

While learning to maintain calm in situations of high stress, I have also learned the importance of my health. It hasn't been the best year for me in terms of health. I got a severe injury that has prevented me from going into the gym to lift weights and will remain that way for the next couple of months. As much as this sucks, I can't do anything. Maintaining good health is crucial to suceed in others aspects of life. Just as easily as it has taken me out of the weight room, it can do so as well for everyday tasks that I take for granted. Health comes above all else.
