I am taking a small detour from learning Javascript. Reason being that there is still some unfinished Python business. I got the wake up call from watching this [small clip](https://youtu.be/z_ESakf05PQ). The point is you can't start something and not finish it. You want to...

This fall semester I was tasked with learning and developing an application with Django, and do it in a Test-Driven manner if possible. This was hard, especially since my first tutorial on Django was [Tango with Django](http://www.tangowithdjango.com/). As good as this tutorial was at teaching me the workflow for developing my first Django application, I still didn't know a thing about testing (it was only touched on very briefly in one of the later chapters). Like any other curious programmer, I consulted the web. After a few searches, I found [Test-Driven Development with Python](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754/index.html). This was the perfect solution for my woes, I had found **THE MANUAL** on how to get started with building an application on a test-first basis. I quickly went through the first 6 chapters, doing one chapter a day. With this I was able to dip my toes into TDD and use the code as reference for my [class project](https://bitbucket.org/danielcodes/pipeline_monitor). However, I would be stuck on this chapter for a month or so since school things would take priority.

Fast foward a bit (school ended), I was still stuck on Chapter 8 of the tutorial. This chapter covered deployment, the requirements included a server and a domain name. I got mine from the [GitHub Student Package](https://education.github.com/pack), both were being used to serve my class project and it needed to stay up for the professor to check that it was "live". I waited until I received my grade and finally unhooked the domain name and destroyed the droplet. It was time to continue this TDD with Python tutorial. You can check my progress [here](https://github.com/danielcodes/superlists). Currently [live](http://danielchia.me/)! :) 

It just leaves a bad taste to leave things hanging, so it feels good to finally get this tutorial rolling again. I'm learning a ton. While I'm at it, I also solidifying my Python knowledge through this [Pluralsight course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/python-fundamentals). The learning never stops.
