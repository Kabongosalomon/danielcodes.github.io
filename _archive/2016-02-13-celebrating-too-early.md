title: Celebrating too early

I had derp moment this Thursday when I thought a deed was done when it wasn't.

> Things are not done until they're done.

I should have known as the procedure felt super rushed and I was just so hyped that there had been a tiny bit of progress on what had been a week long struggle.

This reminded me of 2014's **Rockets vs. Trail Blazers** playoff series. The Rockets were up 2, but the Trail Blazers had one last possession with very little time left. Note that this was Game 6 with the Trail Blazers up 3 - 2, so it was very likely that the Rockets were going to force that Game 7. Lillard sunk a game winning 3, closing out the Rockets.

Funny thing was that Lillard was pretty expressionless after that shot. On an interview with Conan (which I can't seem to find) he'd said that he knew better than to celebrate early as he'd lost a High School game in that same manner and vowed to never celebrate too early again.

### Moral of the story is:

> Don't rush the process, follow through and finish
