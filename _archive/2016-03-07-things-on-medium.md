I have been reading a lot of stuff on Medium lately, though mostly the *Programming* and *Javascript* tags (duh). However, at times my attention diverts to top stories if the title is interesting or click-baity enough. Like the article about the [girl who got fired from Yelp](https://medium.com/@taliajane/an-open-letter-to-my-ceo-fb73df021e7a#.c0q7fr9do), the lady who followed up with a lecture from her own life lessons, the guy who wrote about that we shouldn't make judgement based on one article as we don't know that person. Lastly, the lady who reprimanded the previous lady for lacking basic empathy. I referenced only the first article as the rest of the responses you can find on Medium just by typing the name of the author that created this crazy chain reaction. Though make sure you have time, as these articles are not short and maybe after you'll start qusetioning why you decided to start reading this at all.

On a different note, I came across a more relevant article, titled [Learning programming isn't that hard, deep work is hard](https://medium.com/@benedictfritz/learning-programming-isn-t-that-hard-deep-work-is-hard-40a4cf3104f4). This piece describes the mentality needed to learn to program, that programming takes time to solve and progress comes in slowly **(deep work)** rather than being able to immediately tackle TODO's such as emails, meetings, etc **(shallow work)**. This hit home for me as I am starting to immerse myself in programming, I see that even though at times you feel that you understand things (looking at code, going through tutorials, etc), **you *MUST* go through the struggle of doing the problem yourself**. There is a need to create that muscle memory connection, if your brain remembers struggling with the problem, chances are it'll be no problem the next time around.

And, I finally wrapped up the Intermmediate Algorithms on Free Code Camp :)
