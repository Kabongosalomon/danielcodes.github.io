  <h1 class="post-title">Creating a Voting App with create-react-app and Django</h1>
  <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2018</span>
  <p>The latest project that I worked on was <strong>Pollster</strong>, this is the Voting App in Free Code Camp’s curriculumn. This was a good chance for me to build a project from the ground up and play with technologies that I had been eye balling for a while (mostly Redux). This also meant deploying the application. Check Github repo <a href="https://github.com/danielcodes/voting_app">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here are a few pictures:</p>

<ul class="bxslider">
	<li><img src="/public/img/pollster/pollster_1.png" alt="" /></li>
	<li><img src="/public/img/pollster/pollster_2.png" alt="" /></li>
	<li><img src="/public/img/pollster/pollster_3.png" alt="" /></li>
</ul>

<p>The stack that I chose to use was:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>React + Redux</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Django</strong> (especifically <strong>Django Rest Framework</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I had used React for several side projects but had yet to integrate Redux for state management. This was a good place to start. After reading through the official docs and several tutorials, I settled on using the model provided in <a href="http://jasonwatmore.com/post/2017/12/07/react-redux-jwt-authentication-tutorial-example">this tutorial</a>. However, after getting started I soon ran into trouble as adding CSS required modifying the webpack configuration. Also, I would need to configure bundling the app to be production ready. Due to this, I migrated most of the app to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>. Using CRA, I saved myself some configuration steps and took the good bits from the other tutorial.</p>

<p>From here on, developing the application took the following workflow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a page and decide on what was the data needed</li>
  <li>Create the <strong>constants</strong> for the actions</li>
  <li>Define the <strong>actions</strong> that would call the services, along with request, success and failure functions</li>
  <li>Define <strong>services</strong>, which make the actual http calls to retrieve data handled in the actions</li>
  <li>Define the <strong>reducers</strong> that will update the <strong>new state</strong> accordingly</li>
</ul>

<p>This was actually a pretty tedious process. I guess that’s the Redux way of things. Also, if that made zero sense, take a look at the tutorial listed above.</p>

<p>Before starting any work on the above, I had hastily set up an API using <strong>Django Rest Framework</strong> using viewsets and routers. By creating a few models and their serializers, you can have a full CRUD API with very few lines of code.</p>

<p>With this configuration, I had the following routes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>/questions</strong></li>
  <li><strong>/questions/_id</strong></li>
  <li><strong>/choices</strong></li>
  <li><strong>/choices/_id</strong></li>
  <li><strong>/questions/_id/choices</strong></li>
  <li><strong>/questions/user/user_id</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The first four were given for free, the last two I had to define on my own. Besides this, I used the <code>djoser</code> package to provide <strong>JWT authentication</strong>. Stitching this API and my frontend, I had put together a barebones application.</p>

<p>However, for certain user stories, I needed to secure parts of the application (ie. only auth users can create polls, only owners can delete questions, etc). For this, I needed to add certain permissions to the application and having the viewsets abstracting a lot of the <code>HTTP methods</code> for each route, I didn’t have the finer control that I needed. I ended up having to rewrite the routes. I used this chance to write a full test suite for each of the routes, following <a href="https://realpython.com/blog/python/test-driven-development-of-a-django-restful-api/">this guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="requests-in-development">Requests in development</h3>

<p>While developing the app, CRA has this <code>proxy</code> key that you can throw in <code>package.json</code>. This basically tells webpack to proxy requests to the specified port. For my Django API being served on port <code>8000</code>, the setting looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>'proxy': 'http://localhost:8000'
</code></pre>

<h3 id="preparing-for-production">Preparing for production</h3>

<p>I had worked on the app for a week and a half before I had completed all the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-voting-app">user stories</a>. Naturally the next step was deploying the application. Here is where I was stumped for some time. I asked, <strong>How would I mimic this development set up in production?</strong></p>

<p>I proceded by first creating the build bundle with <code>yarn build</code>, then to serve the static files, I ran (inside the <code>build</code> directory)</p>

<pre><code>python -m http.server 3000
</code></pre>

<p>Here’s where the app broke, requests were not going through as there was no proxy redirecting the requests.</p>

<p>This followed a bit of a research period to find out how I could deploy this application. There weren’t any tutorials with what I was looking for, which was deploying an SPA with a REST API, both sitting on the same machine. However, when I took a closer look, there were tutorials for doing these things separately. I found the following two:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/@timmykko/deploying-create-react-app-with-nginx-and-ubuntu-e6fe83c5e9e7">Deploying create-react-app with Nginx and Ubuntu</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/10/14/how-to-deploy-to-digital-ocean.html">How to Deploy a Django Application to Digital Ocean</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The key to deploying the application was mixing these two tutorials together. Have Nginx serve the static files from the <code>/build</code> directory created by <code>yarn build</code> and proxy requests to the port where the Django application was being served. There was only one thing left to do, try it.</p>

<h3 id="taking-action">Taking action</h3>

<p>I started by first deploying my Django REST API as that was the tougher of the two. I started by first provisioning a $5 linux box from Linode (had some leftover credits). I followed these two guides to set up my server:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://linode.com/docs/getting-started/">Getting started with Linode</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://linode.com/docs/security/securing-your-server/">How to secure your server</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Once this was done, I followed the tutorial for deploying a Django app. The steps looked like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Update the machine (<code>apt-get update and upgrade</code>)</li>
  <li>Install system dependencies (<strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, <strong>Nginx</strong>, <strong>Supervisor</strong>, <strong>Python packages</strong>, etc)</li>
  <li>Create the <strong>python virtualenv</strong> and install the app dependencies</li>
  <li>Configure <strong>Gunicorn</strong> to serve the application</li>
  <li>Configure <strong>Supervisor</strong> to run the Gunicorn server</li>
  <li>Configure <strong>Nginx</strong> to proxy requests to Gunicorn</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="adding-in-the-frontend">Adding in the frontend</h3>

<p>Once the Django application was running, now I needed to serve the static files from the <code>build</code> directory. Changes were made to the <a href="https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/10/14/how-to-deploy-to-digital-ocean.html#configure-nginx">original Nginx configuration file</a>.</p>

<p>To serve the static files from <code>build</code>, these two lines were added</p>

<pre><code>root /home/daniel/voting_app/client/build;
index index.html index.htm;
</code></pre>

<p>Another change was that now the <code>/</code> route would serve <code>index.html</code> not proxy to the Django app</p>

<pre><code>location / {
  try_files $uri /index.html;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the last change that was needed was to proxy the http calls to the Django app</p>

<pre><code>location /api {
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
  proxy_redirect off;
  proxy_pass http://app_server;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Doing these 3 modifications gave me the behaviour I wanted, to serve the <code>build/</code> bundle created by CRA and proxy requests to Gunicorn which was serving the REST API. To see the final Nginx configuration check <a href="https://gist.github.com/danielcodes/8e6ee3eea155d9e6bcd191e8f7bbab6d">this gist</a>.</p>

<h3 id="mistakes-i-made-attempting-this">Mistakes I made attempting this</h3>

<p>This procedure was not as smooth of a transition as I described above. I am going to list some parts that I had to wrestle with before everything came together.</p>

<h5 id="venv-folder-placement">venv folder placement</h5>

<p>While setting up Gunicorn, I initially had my <code>venv</code> directory set up two directories above my Django app directory. This caused all types of <code>file not found</code> errors when I accessed the directories with <code>../../venv/activate</code> on the Gunicorn configuration file.</p>

<p>To avoid this, place the <code>venv</code> only a level above your application directory. In my case this looked like:</p>

<pre><code>
├── client
├── project
└── venv
</code></pre>

<h5 id="make-your-api-routes-distinct">Make your API routes distinct</h5>

<p>For the frontend, React Router takes care of the routing. In the backend, it is the configured Django urls. Not thinking ahead, I had created conflicting urls, where I had a route for <code>/questions</code> in both React Router and Django. Navigating through the site to get to <code>/questions</code> worked fine but if the url was punched in through the browser, I would end up with the Django page serving the JSON data.</p>

<p>To resolve this, I prefixed all Django urls with <code>/api</code>. Now the routes set up by React Router and the Django urls did not conflict.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, a pretty fun experience. Deployment still isn’t the easiest thing to do but I’m happy with the progress.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Deploying a create-react-app SPA and a REST API in the same machine.</li>
  <li>Use Nginx to serve the static files from your SPA build bundle and proxy the requests to the server serving the REST API.</li>
</ul>
