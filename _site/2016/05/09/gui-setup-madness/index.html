  <span class="post-date">09 May 2016</span>
  <h2 id="update-051116">Update 05/11/16</h2>

<p>I attempted to a last ditch effort to get this running, and it worked.</p>

<p>It was mostly thanks to these two posts,</p>

<ul>
  <li>https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ppp-public/BtlzdWGuQpQ</li>
  <li>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31924162/stroustrups-header-error-working-with-fltk</li>
</ul>

<p>With the FLTK package installed, I created a new directory with the sample program and dumped all the headers from <code>GUI/</code>.</p>

<p>This was followed by,</p>

<p>```sh
# replace PROGRAM_NAME with your C++ file</p>

<p>g++ -w -Wall -std=c++11 Graph.cpp Window.cpp GUI.cpp Simple_window.cpp PROGRAM_NAME.cpp -L/usr/local/lib -lfltk_images -lpng -lz -ljpeg -lfltk -lXcursor -lXfixes -lXext -lXft -lfontconfig -lXinerama -lpthread -ldl -lm -lX11 -o PROGRAM_NAME
```</p>

<p>On first run, it did not work due to some inability to convert ifstream to bool as a return value, this was fixed with</p>

<p><code>return (bool)ifstrean_value</code></p>

<p>No need to set up Eclipse, thank goodness.</p>

<hr />

<p>This weekend I spent a solid day trying to configure my computer to run FLTK with the examples from this book <a href="http://stroustrup.com/Programming/">here</a>. FLTK is software used to write graphical applications. So far my experiences with these types of set ups have been nothing but disastrous. A semester ago, I had to install Qt, the process was pretty nightmarish, there wasn’t a proper tutorial and it was basically me searching all of stackoverflow. In the end I got it, but the experience was quite painful and something that I thought I wouldn’t have to go through again. Fast forward, here I am, in need to install GUI software again. Can you feel what’s coming?</p>

<h3 id="lesson-not-learned">Lesson not learned</h3>

<p>From my experience with Qt, I should have known that the process was going to be a bit tricky. But even so, I ignored everything and thought that a simple google search would solve things (Oh, how wrong was I). After a bit of searching I found that I needed to get the tarball (later found that there was an apt-get package), unzip the tarball and run some commands. It went something like this…</p>

<p>First <code>tarball</code>, which was done with much help from <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/25347/what-command-do-i-need-to-unzip-extract-a-tar-gz-file">here</a>,</p>

<p>```sh
tar -xvf file-ending-with.tar.gz</p>

<h1 id="the-flags">the flags</h1>
<p># x extracts, v outputs files being extracted, f for path and name of file
```</p>

<p>This was followed by me running some commands, to install the software,</p>

<p>```sh
# I got these instructions from somewhere in the internet</p>

<p>./configure
sudo make
sudo make install
```</p>

<p>From here on I gained access to the command line tool which was <code>fltk-config</code>, and to compile a file all that was needed was the <code>--compile</code> flag. Some samples worked, and some didn’t. The one that needed to work, did not.</p>

<p>Later, I found that the <code>tarball</code> that I had unzipped, contained a <code>README</code> for Unix systems, describing the exact same process above. Man, I could have saved myself some time if I had been more attentive. Documentation is king.</p>

<p>In there, I was able to run a demo that worked fine. But most importantly, it told me where it had installed the files. They were located in the following paths,</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>/usr/local/include</code> for headers</li>
  <li><code>/usr/local/lib</code> for libraries (files with ending with <code>.a</code>)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>

<p>I found out that the sample program wasn’t compiling because of a bunch of missing headers. In the same link above, there is a link called <code>The complete collection of code ...</code>, another zip. Inside the zip, there was a <code>GUI</code> folder with the missing headers. I proceeded to place this <code>GUI</code> folder in <code>/usr/local/include</code>. This did not work, as the files where inside a directory (GUI/), and so I had to bring them out to the top directory, cluttering everything. After this, the program no longer gave the header errors but now there were undefined references everywhere.</p>

<h3 id="theory">Theory</h3>

<p>My gut tells me that the reason for the errors was a missing library (oh, I had to run <code>make</code> on the GUI folder to obtain a <code>.a</code> file). I couldn’t solve this the way I had done above with the missing headers.</p>

<p>Check this,</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/fltk.png" alt="fltk" /></p>

<p>As you can see in those very tiny letters, the <code>fltk-config --compile file.cpp</code> command is an abbreviation for a <code>g++</code> compilation command which is looking for a very specific <code>libfltk.a</code> file. What I attempted to do was, place the missing library path there. And it still didn’t work. And such was the end of my day. Filled with frustration and a lesson learned.</p>

<h3 id="what-not-to-do-in-the-future">What not to do in the future</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t install software based on stackoverflow instructions, take the time to find the proper documentation (README inside zip file)</li>
  <li>Patience is a virtue, when things don’t work, I start looking for the first hacky solution. Take the time to analyze the error</li>
</ul>

<p>PS. I am most likely just going to install the software on my Windows Desktop as there is a proper instruction for how to do it there.</p>
